# Module_2_Challenge
## Stock Analysis on 12 stocks
The purpose of this challenge was to first use VBA to determine DAQO's stock price and whether or not it was a good buy
* It turns out that DAQO had a loss of 62.6%, so it was not a good buy
The next part was to see how all 12 stocks did between 2017 & 2018
* The VBA knowledge learned for DAQO was expanded to using VBA for all 12 stocks
* * The performace and return of all 12 stocks were able to be seen visually in the worksheet "All Stocks Analysis"
* * * It was in that worksheet where the buttons were created for ease of use for running VBA code

## Findings
For 2017, the overall 12 stocks did really well
Only TERP did not show a positive ROI
So if anyone had the other 11 in their stock portfolio, they would have seen a positive ROI between 8.9%-199.4%
* Assuming the stocks had some serious cash in them, one could be able to use some of their ROI for more stocks or other things that are pressing
* Even if one had just these 12 stocks, 2017 was a good year for that individual
For 2018, the overall 12 stocks did not fare so well. Not only did just 2 provide a positive ROI, but the losses ranged from -3.5% to - 62.6%
